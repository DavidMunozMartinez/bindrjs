      BindrJS is a lightweight data reactivity library built to handle HTML data binding, the most efficient way possible,
      DOM updates are as close as possible to data updates thanks to native JavaScript Proxy API
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the classic HTML string interpolation, it provides the most basic data binding types out of the box and
      virtually any attribute to help make your HTML powerful, dynamic and
      with the smoothest learning curve, mirroring vanilla JavaScript and HTML as much as possible
    </p>
    <p>This library is also meant to be easily adoptable by ongoing projects that are not currently using any data-binding solutions,
      and require the least amount of setup as possible, making it an easy pick for quick small projects or to provide a simple data binding solution to large
      legacy projects
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the out of the box binding types, you are able to add your own binding types and take advantage of the data reactivity system however you see fit
    </p>
    <p>
      All you need to know is how to create <strong>HTML Bind Handlers</strong>

      You can create them with attributes that have a colon ( <code>:</code> ) before them or content inside ( <code>${this.interpolateText}</code> )
      
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>

      <p>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="language-javascript">
          <code class="language-javascript" :innerHTML="this.js">
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>

      <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="language-html">
        <code class="language-markup" :innerHTML="this.html"></code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Both the <code>:class</code> attribute and <code> ${this.interpolateStart}this.bindValue${this.interpolateEnd}</code> will become bind handlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the <code>:class</code> bind handler
        will depend on <code>this.bindClass</code> and <code>${this.interpolateStart}this.bindValue${this.interpolateEnd}</code> depends on <code>this.bindValue</code>.
        And every time each handler dependency is updated, the <strong>HTML Bind Handler</strong>'s will be re-computed
      </p>
