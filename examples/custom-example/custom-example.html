    <h2>Custom bindings:</h2>
    <p>
      You are able to get all the benefit from the data reactivity however you
      want by defining your own custom bind handlers!
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>CustomBindHandler</code> is a global function added by BindrJS that
      you can access anywhere, it takes 2 arguments:
      <li>
        <code>name</code>: is the string that will decide how you bind this
        handler to your HTML
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>compute</code>: is the function that will be called every time
        data attached to this handler changes
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTES:
      <li>
        You have to make sure your custom handlers are defined before any new
        instance of Bind that might need them
      </li>
      <li>
        You can't create custom binds which are already coded in the library
      </li>
    </p>
