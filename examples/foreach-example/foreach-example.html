    <h2> ForEach Binding: <code>:foreach</code></h2>

    <p>
      The <code>:foreach</code> binding renders elements in the DOM for each element available in the provided array,
      this binding type requires
      a simple syntax:
    <pre><code>:foreach="element in this.elements"</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>this.elements</code> represents the array that will be iterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>element</code> is the item currently being iterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>element</code> value is accessible trough each element as its being rendered,and it contains the value
      that it represents in the array
    </p>
    <p>
      You can access the individual index of each element by declaring the <code>:index</code> attribute, if the index attribute is declared, you
      can access it within each element by using the :index keyword
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>NOTE: </h4>
      <p> 
        There still isn't a solid implementation to keep track of array elements, adding or removing full elements to an array
        will trigger a full re-render of its elements. but its currently under development so don't worry  c:
        Targeted modifications to elements in array will ONLY trigger re-renders where that property is referenced on its element
        This is because when adding or removing  full elements from a list we still haven't figured out a solid way to determine
        what was added/removed and where to only re-render that specific element
      </p>
