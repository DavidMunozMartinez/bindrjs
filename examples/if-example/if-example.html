    <h2> If Binding: <code>:if</code></h2>
    <p>
      The <code>:if</code> binding takes the provided expression and only cares if it evaluates truthy, if it does the content is renderer, if its falsy the content disappears entirely from the DOM
    </p>
    <p>
      Its important to know that whatever bindings are in the contents of the elements that make use of the
      <code>:if</code>
      binding are not evaluated if the expression resolves to falsy,
      only when the expression is evaluated to truthy and the content is actually rendered, only then the children bindings are evaluated and computed
    </p>
    <p>
      Since version 1.2.0 You can also make use of the <code>:else</code> handler, this handler only works when specified after a valid if handler
