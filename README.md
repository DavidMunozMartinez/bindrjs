# bindrJS
My attempt at a !framework for efficient HTML data binding

Don't mind me just re-inventing the wheel.
This is my attempt at creating a simple enough HTML render engine similar to what ALL popular front-end frameworks/libraries already do perfectly, AKA data binding, except "cheaper" and without the extra fancy features.

This is mainly a learning experience to get a feel for the kind of problems modern web development has and how different frameworks solve them.

You may be interested in this library if you ONLY want to add data binding to your web app, in the end this is just a javascript library, without project structures or design patterns.

This library requires no configuration, or setup, just include the js bundle into your page and you are ready to start binding data to your HTML

### Download the code

```
// Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DavidMunozMartinez/bindrJS.git
// Go to directory
cd bindrjs
// Install dependencies
npm run install
```
### Compile
```
npm run compile
```
### Run examples
```
npm run examples
```

This will open a local browser with an instance of live server running index.html in the examples folder.
Mind you the examples page looks like ðŸ’© at the moment and more than an examples page is my testing
environment.


## How to use

```javascript
// New instance of Bind
let MainContent = new Bind({
  // Id of the element that will benefit from the Bind context
  id: 'main-content', // (Required)
  // HTML template string or path to HTML file, if provided it will replace
  // the content of the container found with the id (paths only work when running the app in a live server)
  template: '', // (Optional)
  // Reactive properties that will be provided in the template 
  bind: { // (Optional)
    // These are accessible in the template trough the "this" keyword
    text: 'Hello world!'
  }
});

// This is 100% reactive!
MainContent.bind

// You can access the properties of the Bind instance
console.log(MainContent.bind.text);
// > Hello world!

// And reassign them
MainContent.bind.text = 'Changing reactive data';
// Now any part of the template that depends on "this.text" property WILL automatically be updated accordingly
```

NOTE: If you add new properties to the bind object after it's been instantiated, those will not be reactive, if you need more reactive properties you
should add all the properties that the template will need with null values when the Bind class is being instantiated

Thanks for passing by, more things are under active development.
